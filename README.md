# DigitTactileSensor_IITGNRobotics

## Overview
This is a prototype tactile sensor inspired by Meta‚Äôs DIGIT, designed to explore touch sensing using simple, affordable components. The system uses a Raspberry Pi Camera V2, RGB LEDs, and a 15A elastomer layer with printed markers to visualize and measure contact deformation.


## üîß Hardware Summary
Component	Description
Camera	Raspberry Pi Camera V2
Illumination	1 Red, 1 Green, 1 Blue LED
Case	3D printed body with acrylic front window
Sensing Surface	15 Shore A elastomer with printed markers

## üéØ Goals
Vision-based deformation tracking

Marker displacement analysis

Normal & shear force estimation (basic model)

Modular and open for experimentation

## üöß Current Status
This is an early-stage prototype for research and learning purposes. Force estimation is currently being explored using simple geometric displacement models.

## üß∞ Hardware Design
All CAD and manufacturing files needed to build the sensor are included in this repository. The design focuses on simplicity, modularity, and ease of 3D printing.
