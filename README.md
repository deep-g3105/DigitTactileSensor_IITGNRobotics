# DigitTactileSensor_IITGNRobotics

## Overview
This is a prototype tactile sensor inspired by Metaâ€™s DIGIT, designed to explore touch sensing using simple, affordable components. The system uses a Raspberry Pi Camera V2, RGB LEDs, and a 15A elastomer layer with printed markers to visualize and measure contact deformation.

The goal is to perform normal and shear force estimation by tracking marker displacements during physical interactions.
